# Monsters Rolodex

I am on a mission to better understand react, so the first project i got to work on was monsters rolodex, using class components. This is a simple project that fetches from a database and allows a user to filter the list of monsters using names.

## Overview

### Tech Stack Used

- React

### What I Learned

What react class components are, state and shallow merge, setState and passing it a callback , how and when does react render i.e when setState is called and props change, lifecycle method; componentDidMount(), ComponentDidUpdate() and componentWillUnmount().
